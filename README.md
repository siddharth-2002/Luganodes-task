# Ethereum Deposit Tracker - Task Document for VIT SDE Hiring at Luganodes

This project focuses on developing a robust Ethereum Deposit Tracker to monitor and record ETH deposits on the Beacon Deposit Contract (0x00000000219ab540356cBB839Cbe05303d7705Fa). Leveraging Ethereum RPC methods, the tracker efficiently retrieves deposit details like transaction amount, sender address, and timestamp. It also supports real-time data fetching, error handling, and logging. Optional features include Grafana dashboards for monitoring and Telegram notifications for deposit alerts.
