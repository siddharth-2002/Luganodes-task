Ethereum Deposit Tracker - Task Document for VIT SDE Hiring at Luganodes
========================================================================

This project aims to build a robust Ethereum Deposit Tracker that monitors and records ETH deposits on the Beacon Deposit Contract (address: 0x00000000219ab540356cBB839Cbe05303d7705Fa). Using Ethereum RPC methods, the tracker will fetch deposit details such as transaction amount, sender address, and timestamp, and store them efficiently. The system will handle multiple deposits, offer real-time data fetching, and include error handling and logging. Optional features include Grafana dashboards for monitoring and Telegram notifications for new deposits.
